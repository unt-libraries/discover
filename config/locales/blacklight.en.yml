      title: 'About Discover'
      content: "<p>We've upgraded catalog searching to be faster and more precise.
          <strong>Discover</strong> searches through descriptive records of 3+ million items,
          including books, media, music, and more. Search for what is important to you, and then
          refine your results using <span class=\"d-none d-sm-inline\">the filters that appear to
          the left-hand side of the screen</span><span class=\"d-sm-none\">filters that appear when
          tapping the \"Limit your search <i class=\"fas fa-bars\"></i>\" bar, above</span>.</p>
        <p>Not sure where to begin? Start with a popular filter <span class=\"d-none d-sm-inline\">
          on the left</span>, or <a href=\"/?utf8=✓&q=&search_field=text&tour=true\">
          browse the rest of the options here</a>. Discover does not search inside books/journals;
          for full-text searching of articles, <a href=\"https://untexas.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/advanced\">
          try this tool</a> or search one of our many <a href=\"https://guides.library.unt.edu/az.php\">
          subscription databases</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> We are still developing Discover and some of the <a href=\"https://iii.library.unt.edu\">
          old catalog</a> hasn't made it over yet. You can still use the <a href=\"https://iii.library.unt.edu\">
          old catalog</a> if needed, but you can also expect Discover to be continuously upgraded and improved.</p>"
